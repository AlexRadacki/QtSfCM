Qt system for cultural mediation

Master thesis for the academic discipline "Leadership in the creative industries" in winter semester 2016/2017 by Alexander Radacki

The task is to create a prototype for a mediasystem which will be used for cultural mediation. Due to the multi-platform support we decided to use Qt as development framework. The finished program should run multiple display devices and render 2D/3D content - both still and moving.

Usage:
- install a c++ compiler (e.g. Visual Studio C++ for windows)
- install github
- install Qt Creator
